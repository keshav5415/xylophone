     run this app now and your phone is on your silent on your
     physical device , then it will not make a sound !

     able to use different voices.

     Why It Still Works:
     Simplified Assumptions: The code makes several assumptions (like the audio
     file being present and the app not needing custom audio session
     configurations) that may hold in simple cases. The app uses default
     behaviors and succeeds without errors, as long as these assumptions remain
     true.

/*
All info about "sender" :-
 
Detailed Explanation:
->'@IBAction func keyPressed(_ sender: UIButton)': This is an action method connected to a button in your storyboard or xib file.
->'sender': The parameter 'sender' is of type 'UIButton'. It refers to the specific button that was tapped by the user.
 
 
 How It Works:
 When a button is pressed, it triggers the 'keyPressed' method. The 'sender'
 parameter in the method contains information about the button that was pressed. You
 use 'sender' to access properties of that button, such as its title or tag, to
 determine which button was pressed and to perform the appropriate action.

 
 Example:
 If you have multiple buttons (e.g., for different notes in your xylophone app),
 'sender' allows you to determine which button was pressed and then act accordingly.
